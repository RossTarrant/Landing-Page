# Landing-Page

I've been learning flexbox over the last week.

This project where I will be creating a template landing page will be a culmination of all I have learned about flexbox. I have chosen to theme the template with the theme of a new up and coming coffee shop.

**SUMMARY OF THE PROJECT:**

_**Some of the things I have learned from completing this project:**_

- Using divs/classes to style a web page.

- Using flexbox to structure the layout of a web page and position all of the components.

- Various CSS properties I had not encountered yet, such as rounding of edges on boxes.

_**Some of the challenges I faced during this project:**_

- Alignment was tricky to begin with, however I soon got the hang of it thanks to many tutorials and resources such as Flexbox Zombies and Flexbox Froggy.

- My biggest challenge was making sure the page scales correctly when resized. Although I don't think it is perfect, I am quite happy with how it scales down. **_Note: this project was not meant to be a responsive design that works on mobile devices._**

- Structuring the HTML was actually a lot tougher than I thought it would be. I really had to think very carefully about each section and break it down into smaller components for flexbox to work correctly.

In conclusion, I feel I could definitely spend a lot more time perfecting this page, however I am keen and eager to move onto my next project. I am happy with what I have achieved and when compared with the odin recipes page I created before, this really demonstrates how much I have learned in such a short amount of time.

_**If I was to spend more time on this project I would:**_

- Spend some time "cleaning up" the HTML and CSS so that it is much more organised and simpler to read/understand.

- Add further content to the page, exploring new layouts using flexbox.
